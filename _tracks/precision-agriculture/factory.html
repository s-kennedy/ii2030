title: Precision Agriculture for Smallholder Farmers
subtitle: How can we increase smallholder yields through precision agriculture?
icon_path: /assets/images/agri-icon.png
track_description: This is a great description.
intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> is disruptive technology doing for agriculture?
    answer: Precision Agriculture uses sensors, Big Data and digitized farming equipment to enable farmers to observe, measure and respond to variabilities in their environment (e.g. climate, soil composition, crop practices and disease). With this technology, farmers around the world are able to conserve valuable resources, such as water and fertilizer, while increasing both quality and quantity of their yields.
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> do we need more inclusive solutions?
    answer: At present, precision agriculture is largely out of the reach of smallholder farmers. Individual services to inform farmers of weather patterns, soil structure, agricultural practices etc. exist, but are mostly isolated. Moreover, farmers have difficulty implementing the recommendations since the often lack access to better inputs, machinery or markets. Making precision agriculture and the required inputs available to farmers could magnify their yields and earnings, while saving resources and conserving the environment.
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
    answer: At ii2030, weâ€™ll bring together
    list:
      - item: A social entrepreneur using smartphone applications to provide smallholders with more accurate farm information and access to other actors in the agricultural ecosystem.
      - item: An NGO working locally with smallholder farmers to increase their business capacity and skills.
      - item: A major company developing digitized and smart farming machinery and equipment.
      - item: Agricultural product off-takers, who require end-to-end traceability to know exactly what went into production.
      - item: The head of a smallholder farmer cooperative, who can advise the team on the needs and usability of the solution.
  - question: <span class="bold">How</span> will we create impact?
    answer: At the conclusion of the workshop in Berlin, the team will walk away with a concrete strategy to make digital farming affordable and accessible to smallholder farmers. The ii2030 online platform will continue to be used by the team following the workshop, to develop a prototype and test the solution with smallholder farmers in the field, with guidance and support from Endeva. Together, the team will implement a solution that will drive economic growth and impact not only for smallholder farmers and agribusiness, but for all those affected by hunger and malnutrition.

    text: In a design-thinking workshop of up to 10 participants, we will work out how technology can drive inclusive innovation, and what is needed to achieve a solution. Participants are carefully selected to bring together those actors who can make the change.

    text: Throughout the day, a networking assembly line, factory whistle speeches and a canteen exhibition will allow participants to get inspired and connect outside their workshop.

    text: An ii2030 online platform will be used for participants to start connecting and preparing for the workshop prior to the event and to continue their collaboration following the co-creation workshop. In the follow-up, the team will receive support from Endeva as they work on improving and implementing the solution in the field.

    text: Design-thinking methodology is a collaborative solution-based approach to solving complex challenges. The strategic process will guide the team of like-minded partners in co-creating concrete, innovative and user-friendly solutions in a 1-day, action-packed workshop.
