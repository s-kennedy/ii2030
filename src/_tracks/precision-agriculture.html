track_description: This is a great description.
intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> is disruptive technology doing for agriculture?
    answer: Precision Agriculture allows farmers to manage their fields for maximum output by using data (e.g. on weather, soil and diseases) and digitized farming equipment to apply the right inputs at the right time. With this technology, farmers are able to conserve valuable resources, such as water and fertilizer, and reduce pollution while increasing both quality and quantity of their yields.
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> do we need more inclusive solutions?
    answer: The demand for food is increasing. By 2030, there will be a projected 9.3 billion people on the globe, most of them in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In these regions, 80% of the farmland is managed by smallholder farmers, who produce 80% of the food consumed. Globally, there are more than 500 million small farms. <br><br>Precision agriculture could boost the productivity of smallholder farmers, who usually lack access to information and have few means to afford inputs. With precision agriculture, they could increase yields and maximize the payback of their investments.
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
    answer: The precision agriculture track will bring together
    list:
      - item: Startups and social entrepreneurs offering mobile solutions to provide smallholders with timely and accurate information about weather, soil, diseases, and markets
      - item: Corporates producing and selling agricultural inputs, including seed, fertilizer and crop protection, as well as irrigation systems and other machinery
      - item: NGOs building capacities of and organizing smallholder farmers locally
      - item: Agricultural product off-takers, who require end-to-end traceability to know exactly what went into production
      - item: The head of a smallholder farmer cooperative, who can advise the team on the needs and usability of the solution
    callToAction: If you fit one of these profiles, please apply for an invitation through our registration process.
  - question: <span class="bold">How</span> will we create impact?
    answer: At the conclusion of the workshop in Berlin, the team will walk away with a concrete strategy to make digital farming affordable and accessible to smallholder farmers. The ii2030 online platform will continue to be used by the team following the workshop, to develop a prototype and test the solution with smallholder farmers in the field, with guidance and support from Endeva. Together, the team will implement a solution that will drive economic growth and impact not only for smallholder farmers and agribusiness, but for all those affected by hunger and malnutrition.
