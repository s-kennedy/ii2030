intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> is disruptive technology doing for better health outcomes?
    answer: Health professionals have to know countless symptoms from the top of their head in order to diagnose a patient. Artificial intelligence (AI) is superior in that it can memorize and analyze huge amounts of data, thus helping doctors to make faster and more accurate diagnoses. 
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> do we need more inclusive solutions?
    answer: The need for accurate diagnoses is especially pressing in regions with a chronic shortage of well-trained health professionals – i.e., in many rural areas in Africa and Asia. For the most part, the best healthcare options are health workers, who can perform basic medical diagnoses. Artificial intelligence can help bring accurate diagnosis to underserved areas. It provides a repository of knowledge that helps health workers to decide whether a patient can be attended to by simple measures such as painkillers, or needs to be referred to a specialist.
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
    answer: ii2030 aims to bring together experts and organizations who will contribute to the solution – and continue its development and implementation following the 2-day event. They may include
    list:
      - item: Companies developing AI software that give diagnoses 
      - item: Social enterprises with networks of health workers that reach out to patients in low-income markets
      - item: Artificial intelligence experts
      - item: Companies working on telemedicine
      - item: Data specialists, particularly those working on patient health records
      - item: Corporate representatives with a focus on digital health
      - item: Experts running incubators or consultancies specializing in health, digital health, AI and health
    callToAction: If you fit one of these profiles, please apply for an invitation through our registration process.
  - question: <span class="bold">How</span> will we create impact?
    answer: This track aims to support companies and organizations to find a concrete strategy on how to improve access to healthcare in low-income markets with technology. In the health track at the ii2030 event, we will ideate to identify project or business model opportunities that help translate the potential of AI technology to the realities in rural Africa or Asia. Concretely, the output shall help customize the technology to the needs of health workers (e.g., employed by social enterprises or NGOs) and their patients’ needs.
