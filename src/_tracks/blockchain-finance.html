track_description: This is a great description.
intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> can blockchain technology offer entrepreneurs?
    answer: The blockchain principle that underlies cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) offers an enormous opportunity for people to attain more prosperity. Digital financial technologies not only enable the ‘unbanked’ to use an efficient and reliable financial system for the first time, also the new systems of financial trust supported by the blockchain allow entrepreneurs from less established economic systems to participate fully in the global economy.
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> do we need more inclusive solutions?
    answer: “Blockchain, Bitcoin, the Next Big Thing!“. That’s what’s being shouted from the rooftops. But don’t celebrate just yet - a lot of it is still vague, and the hype is also waning in development aid. Nonetheless, there are breakthroughs in the digitization of financial transactions via blockchain and bitcoin.  BitPesa, a Kenya-based start-up reduces remittance-fees by sending Bitcoin, rather than traditional currency, across borders.
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
    answer: ii2030 aims to bring together experts and organizations who will contribute to the solution – and continue its development and implementation following the 2-day event. They may include
    list:
      - item: Start-ups and social entrepreneurs offering blockchain-solutions for entrepreneurs in developing markets
      - item: Financial Experts and Investors working with blockchain-based services or companies 
      - item: Developers that work with blockchain-technology
      - item: Innovators from the international development community
    callToAction: If you fit one of these profiles, please apply for an invitation through our registration process.
  - question: <span class="bold">How</span> will we create impact?
    answer: During the 2-day co-creation process, participants will gain a full perspective of blockchain technology, get to know entrepreneurs who work with blockchain (through the Inclusive Innovation Tour) and design a blockchain-prototype for entrepreneurs in developing markets. After the event, participants will continue the collaboration along the roadmap towards a pilot project within one year, with support from Endeva and partners. <br><br> By harnessing blockchain technology, the resulting solution will reduce entry barriers for entrepreneurs to access global markets and provide a transparent and accountable infrastructure for financial transactions.
