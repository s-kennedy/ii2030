track_description: This is a great description.
intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> can drones do to improve the lives of low income consumers in Sub-Saharan Africa?
    answer: Drones can deliver critical medical supplies to remote areas offering timely access all year round. They can detect and safely detonate landmines and play a critical role in search and rescue missions after natural disasters. Drones are able to offer a more efficient way to deliver products to consumers through last mile distribution, enable farmers to survey and optimize their land and resources allowing them to maximize their output or facilitate reforestation and the conservation of wildlife. The possibilities and opportunities provided through the use of drones are endless.
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> do we need more inclusive solutions?
    answer: Although the use of drones for good is likely to drive significant growth and offer seismic impact in the future, few drone solutions are in place at present. Several barriers are preventing entrepreneurs from quickly developing and delivering drone solutions. A key challenge is that it is expensive and requires specialized know how. Each entrepreneur must create and manage a drone network as well as the details related to the delivery of a specific solution. If we could create an efficient drone network that is multifunctional and modular we could make it much easier for local entrepreneurs to attach a wide range of solutions to an existing network. This would unlock an infinite range of opportunities to improve the outcomes of low-income consumers.
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
    answer: At ii2030, we’ll bring together

    callToAction: If you fit one of these profiles, please apply for an invitation through our registration process.
  - question: <span class="bold">How</span> will we create impact?
    answer: At the conclusion of the workshop in Berlin, participants will have the following
    list:
      - item: 'CONCRETE IDEAS: Have concrete ideas on how to create the ultimate multifunctional drones network in Sub-Saharan Africa to allow African entrepreneurs to create businesses that unleash the potential of drones for good'
      - item: 'PARTNERS: Have closely worked with potential partners and know if they want to continue developing the idea together'
      - item: 'FUNDING: Have met with potential funding partners and investors that can invest in making this idea a reality'
      - item: 'WAY FORWARD: ii2030 is more than just an event, interactions and progress will continue beyond the close of the event. This will also be facilitated by an online platform to be used by teams to continue to develop a prototype and test the solution in the field, with ongoing support from Endeva and our network partners.'

    text: Participants will gain inspiration from and knowledge on the various perspectives of how inclusive innovation will create positive change. They will gain an up-close-and-personal look into the three organizations, connect with their leaders and use the inspiration to guide and motivate them through their co-creation journey at the Inclusive Innovation Factory and beyond.

tour_stops_headline: 'The Drones track will take participants on a tour of the following three experiences:'

tour_stops:
  - organization: Virtual Reality Stop
    description: We kick off the tour with a quick virtual stop at a village in Kenya’s Machakos County. <br> This stops gives us a glimpse of the context today in rural Africa within which our solution will exist.
