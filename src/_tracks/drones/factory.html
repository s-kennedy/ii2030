track_description: This is a great description.
intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> can drones do to improve the lives of low income consumers in Sub-Saharan Africa?
    answer: Drones can deliver critical medical supplies to remote areas offering timely access all year round. They can detect and safely detonate landmines and play a critical role in search and rescue missions after natural disasters. Drones are able to offer a more efficient way to deliver products to consumers through last mile distribution, enable farmers to survey and optimize their land and resources allowing them to maximize their output or facilitate reforestation and the conservation of wildlife. The possibilities and opportunities provided through the use of drones are endless.
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> do we need more inclusive solutions?
    answer: Although the use of drones for good is likely to drive significant growth and offer seismic impact in the future, few drone solutions are in place at present. Several barriers are preventing entrepreneurs from quickly developing and delivering drone solutions. A key challenge is that it is expensive and requires specialized know how. Each entrepreneur must create and manage a drone network as well as the details related to the delivery of a specific solution. If we could create an efficient drone network that is multifunctional and modular we could make it much easier for local entrepreneurs to attach a wide range of solutions to an existing network. Enabling an infinite range of opportunities to improve the outcomes of low-income consumers.
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
