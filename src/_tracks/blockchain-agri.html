track_description: This is a great description.
intro_slides:
  - question: <span class="bold">What</span> is Blockchain technology?
    answer: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. It makes transactions recordable and trackable, providing a system that is transparent, efficient and market-oriented. Blockchain ensures the integrity of the value exchanged without having a trusted third party. For more information www.thefork.online 
  - question: <span class="bold">Why</span> will it impact sustainable consumption and production processes?
    answer: Per capita, we are eating more and we are eating better. We know more about our food. And we demand more of our food. This gives an increasingly complex food system with higher levels of risk, serious transportation and traceability challenges, and disturbing waste and recall costs, to name just a few implications. <br><br> Blockchain signposts a new era of openness, decentralization and global inclusion. The technology can accelerate solutions for the issues arising in complex food systems, enhancing – and even disrupting - sustainable consumption and production. <br><br> However, to what extent it will accelerate and disrupt results on SDGs, depends on further technical developments and – notoriously - its implementation. Will blockchain make current consumption and production processes more sustainable, will it create whole new governance structures, or is it just another hype, will we work as we do now, just using different names? 
  - question: <span class="bold">Who</span> would we like to attend?
    answer: ii2030 aims to bring together experts and organizations who will contribute to the solution – and continue its development and implementation following the 2-day event. They may include

    callToAction: If you fit one of these profiles, please apply for an invitation through our registration process.
  - question: <span class="bold">How</span> will we accelerate food integrity?
    answer: The extent to which this new technology realizes its potential, depends on how well we manage its development. The technology is certainly in a hype. It is immature, comparable to the internet of 1992. Many implementation challenges that we have today, remain or might even get more prominent using blockchain technology. However, the upside of this new technology is huge. We therefore need to join forces in developing the technology and maximize the impact on SGDs.

    text: Our tour guides will take participants on an exploration of Berlin’s buzzing inclusive innovation scene to provide inspiration and information for each track.
  - img_path: /assets/images/conf-pic-5.jpg
    text: The 4-hour tour will take participants to 3 visionary organizations, where hosts will lead a discussion on how greater inclusion in their sector will impact society in 2030.
  - img_path: /assets/images/conf-pic-6.jpg
    text: The day will end with a “Meet & Greet” networking dinner. Participants from all tracks will reconvene over dinner to share what they have learned and get to know one another.
  - img_path: /assets/images/conf-pic-7.jpg
    text: Participants will gain inspiration from and knowledge on the various perspectives of how inclusive innovation will create positive change. They will gain an up-close-and-personal look into the three organizations, connect with their leaders and use the inspiration to guide and motivate them through their co-creation journey at the Inclusive Innovation Factory and beyond.

    text: In a design-thinking workshop of up to 10 participants, we will work out how technology can drive inclusive innovation, and what is needed to achieve a solution. Participants are carefully selected to bring together those actors who can make the change.
  - img_path: /assets/images/conf-pic-9.jpg
    text: Throughout the day, a networking assembly line, factory whistle speeches and a canteen exhibition will allow participants to get inspired and connect outside their workshop.
  - img_path: /assets/images/conf-pic-10.jpg
    text: An ii2030 online platform will be used for participants to start connecting and preparing for the workshop prior to the event and to continue their collaboration following the co-creation workshop. In the follow-up, the team will receive support from Endeva as they work on improving and implementing the solution in the field.

    - text: At the conclusion of the 1-day co-creation workshop, participants of the track will have developed a concrete solution that will be implemented with support from Endeva. This track will enhance the open-source private hyperledger technology for organic grapes from South Africa to a plate in The Netherlands. It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of certifying and verifying food quality. We will assess these impacts on SDG12.
