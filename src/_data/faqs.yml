        - For more information on applying or registering for ii2030, please visit our <a href="https://iba.ventures/inclusive-innovation-factory/">registration page</a>.
    - question: How many people can join the event from my company/organization?
      answer:
        paras:
        - In our experience, co-creation workshops work most efficiently and effectively    with small groups (between 6-10 individuals) consisting of representatives from diverse backgrounds. Thus, it is suggested that each company or organization sends one representative to the event in Berlin.
        - However, if you believe it would add value to have additional representatives from your organisation because they would bring a skillset that would otherwise be missing, please contact us to buy more than one ticket for your organisation.
